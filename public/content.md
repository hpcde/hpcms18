### Description [¶](#description)
<!-- <article class="section-content"> -->
&emsp;High-performance computinghas been applied to accelerate advanced modeling andsimulation(M&S)in many different fields of engineering, such as virtual reactors, hydrology, meteorology,to solve multi-physical problems.
The multi-physics simulations, as somecombination of physical models and exascale heterogeneous supercomputers, have proposed significant challenges in recent years.
For example, materials simulation in nuclear reactors is required tocombine materials modeling methods, mathematical models andparallel algorithmsin order to make the best use ofthe supercomputers of the present and future. Theworkshop focused on innovative mathematical modeling, parallelalgorithms, high-performance computing tools and virtualization. 
It aimed at bringing together differentresearchers from, such as applied mathematics, computer science, materials science, hydrology, etc., to discuss the interdisciplinaryissue of multi-physics modeling methods and parallel algorithms by which the simulation and optimization onhigh-performance computing systems can be achieved.
